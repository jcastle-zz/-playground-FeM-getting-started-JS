# Three Pillars of JS
This is an exercise to briefly practice the three pillars of JS: Types / Coercion, Scope / Closures, and `this` / Prototypes.

## Instructions

1. In the `printFavoriteBooks()` function, make sure there's no accidental type conversion (ie, from number to string).
	- Hint: Use `String(..)` to coerce something to a string type.

2. Move the `addFavoriteBook(..)` and `printFavoriteBooks()` functions into the `Bookshelf` class as methods. Modify them so they use the `this` keyword to access the `favoriteBooks` array.
	- Hint: `class` methods don't use the `function` keyword, just their name.

3. Fill out the definition of the `loadBooks(..)` function, which should receive an instance of the `Bookshelf` class that you will pass to it.

4. `loadBooks(..)` should call the provided `fakeAjax(..)`, using `BOOK_API` as the URL and an inline function expression as the callback.

5. The callback will be passed an array of book names. Loop through this array, passing each book name to the `addFavoriteBook(..)` method of the `Bookshelf` instance passed to `loadBooks(..)`. Then call the `printFavoriteBooks()` method.

6. Create an instance of `Bookshelf` class, and pass it as an argument to `loadBooks(..)`.
	- Hint: Class instantiation: `new Whatever()`.

class Bookshelf {
	constructor() {
		this.favoriteBooks = [];
	}

	// TODO: define methods `addFavoriteBook(..)`
	// and `printFavoriteBooks()`

	addFavoriteBook(bookName) {
		if (!bookName.includes("Great")) {
			this.favoriteBooks.push(bookName);
		}
	}

	printFavoriteBooks() {
		console.log(`Favorite Books: ${String(this.favoriteBooks.length)}`);
		for (let bookName of this.favoriteBooks) {
			console.log(bookName);
		}
	}
}

function loadBooks(theBookShelf) {
	fakeAjax(BOOK_API, function onBooks(bookNames) {
		for (let bookName of bookNames) {
			theBookShelf.addFavoriteBook(bookName);
		}
		theBookShelf.printFavoriteBooks();
	});
}

var BOOK_API = "https://some.url/api";
var myBooks = new Bookshelf();
loadBooks(myBooks);


// ***********************

// NOTE: don't modify this function at all
function fakeAjax(url,cb) {
	setTimeout(function fakeLoadingDelay(){
		cb([
			"A Song of Ice and Fire",
			"The Great Gatsby",
			"Crime & Punishment",
			"Great Expectations",
			"You Don't Know JS"
		]);
	},500);
}
